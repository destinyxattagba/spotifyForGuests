<h3>
    Welcome to Spotify for Guests! I made this website because I'm a music lover
    and when I go on a trip, whether for work or for pleasure, I love listening to either my current favorites
    or discovering something new.
</h3>
<p>
    On this website, you'll be able to generate a random playlist of the top songs in the genres that you select,
    you'll be able to look at the current top 50 songs as well as the top artists,
    and you'll also be able to play a game to guess the artist.

    I made this website as a way to experiment with making calls to API endpoints and to practice web development. This
    was brought to you by: HTML, Flask, and Python :)
